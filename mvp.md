üí∞ MVP Monetization
The MVP version will be free, serving for testing, market validation, and gathering user feedback. Premium features will be introduced in later development phases.

üóìÔ∏è Estimated MVP Timeline
Including the map in the MVP will increase complexity and potential development time. A precise estimate would require a detailed analysis of Mapbox SDK implementation in the context of Compose Multiplatform and offline mode, but it will certainly extend the initially estimated 2-4 weeks.
